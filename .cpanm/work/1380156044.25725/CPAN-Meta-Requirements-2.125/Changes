Revision history for CPAN-Meta-Requirements

2.125     2013-09-23 14:51:14 America/New_York

  [FIXED]

    - updated Makefile.PL logic to support PERL_NO_HIGHLANDER

2.124     2013-09-23 06:40:07 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Better fix than 2.123.  On old perls, rather than install into
      'core', we continue to install into the proper 'site' library,
      but force UNINST=1 when necessary to remove stale copies
      from ExtUtils::MakeMaker

2.123     2013-08-30 12:17:14 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - On Perls prior to v5.12, CPAN::Meta::Requirements will be installed
      into the 'core' library path to avoid an older version bundled with
      ExtUtils::MakeMaker and installed there taking precedence.

2.122     2012-05-02 17:29:17 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fix typo in documentation: the exclusion symbol is "!=" rather than
      just "!". The implemenation was correct, just the docs were wrong.
      [rt.cpan.org #76948; ticket and patch from hasch-cpan@cozap.com]

2.121     2012-04-01 15:05:15 Europe/Paris

    - Split out from CPAN::Meta into own distribution
